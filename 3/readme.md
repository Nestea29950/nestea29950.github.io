## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes

## My process

### Built with

- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

My first project with Typescript, I really liked it and found it very different. I decided to make a slightly simpler project, so as not to get too stuck in the development, but I will definitely make some more elaborate ones, but this one was definitely a lot of fun to do!
